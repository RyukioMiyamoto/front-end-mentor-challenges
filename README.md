# Overview

I created this repository in order to keep track of all free [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges I managed to complete.

The main focus on these challenges is practicing **CSS with SASS** following **BEM** patterns, _semantic_ and _accessible_ **HTML** and some funcitonalities using **Javascript**.

# Live Demo

All challenges are available through a portfolio made for displaying them live.
